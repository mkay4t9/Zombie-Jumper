# Zombie-Jumper


"ZombieJumper," my very first game, was born in November 2022, crafted using the Unity game engine. The driving force behind its creation was my desire to delve into Unity's fundamental concepts and put into practice the skills I acquired through FreeCodeCamp's online tutorials.

To ensure an engaging and user-friendly experience, I designed a basic UI tailored for mobile phones. This not only made the game more logical but also added to its visual appeal. To make it playable on mobile devices, I incorporated intuitive control buttons.

In "ZombieJumper," players must navigate a treacherous world overrun by zombies. Some of these undead creatures are docile, while others are relentlessly aggressive. The game incorporates a scoring system, rewarding players for successfully leaping over zombies. Your high score is saved, providing a constant challenge to beat your personal best.

This game is endless, offering endless excitement and a chance to test your skills against increasingly challenging waves of zombies. "ZombieJumper" is a testament to my dedication to learning and a fun mobile gaming experience for all.
